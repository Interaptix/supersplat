Camera Poses - Panel	
	Refresh - need to confirm what this one did as it seems to be a 'dead' button (use update)
	Clear All - clear all poses on the time line(fixed)
	Sort by Frame - sorts by Frame Number - some of my edits made the panel get out of order & this just resorts
	Copy to last - any selected pose will be copied to the last frame
	Mode interpolate using Liner/circular(Jury is still out on this one - needs further testing)
	Record Camera movements at set interval (ms) to make cameraP	
	Stretch Poses all existing poses are stretched so you can record or make close frames of 20 frames and then 'equally' stretch to 360
	Read cameraP from timeline into Editor panel
	Update cameraP to timeline after editing
	Export Camera (Poses) in Json Format of poses/FOV(lens.length)/time

	Edit can change Cam xyx, target xyz and FOV
	Edit can Copy Poses

	Edit Camera Rotations - (There is a bit of Duplication here so some need to go)
		ZUp -> Yup
		Invert Y
		Blender->SS
		Reset Coords - this was supposed to reset to the 'read file' but doesn't seem to do anything at the moment
	
	
TimeLine
	added << jump to 0
	added >> jump to end
	added - zoom out on timeline
	added + zoom out on timeline
	added [] zoom to fit timeline
	There is also a ctrl-mouse to zoom in/out on the timeline: but its quite finicky as to exactly where you have the mouse pointer.
	
	
+ I also have the Blender plugin and a standalone json creator for complex camera pose creation.
